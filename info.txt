paths project: 

cd C:\Users\mhaxh\OneDrive\Desktop\vf_dashboard_2025
npm start

backend:

cd C:\Users\mhaxh\OneDrive\Desktop\vf_dashboard_2025\restaurant-backend



psql pass:

Mateo13141*
port 5432



First we start the backend server which connects to the PostgreSQL data we input with this cmd command

go to directory of backend server

type: node server.js


Then we start the react app by going to the dashboard
then doing npm start to launch react app which connects with the backend server.js which holds the data








Working with container files


first we need to create image, then use that image with a container
\
Navigate first to correct directory
cd "C:\Users\mhaxh\OneDrive\Desktop\VilaFerdinand\restaurant-cron-jobs"


Then we clear cached images and contatiners so it doesnt use old ones

docker system prune -af


Rebuild the image with no cache

docker build --no-cache -t vilaferdinand:latest .


Run Updated Container with logs

docker run --name vilaferdinand_container -d vilaferdinand:latest












Working GitHub Versions CMD 

Add the folder if already not done with this code:

git init

Then we choose reposity url or make a new repositry and use that url, well be using exisiting One


git remote add origin https://github.com/MateoHaxhi07/Restaurant_Dashboard



First line uploads all changes made to all files on GitHub

git add .


Second thing we need to do is commit the changes on GitHub with this code and a message, which shows everything changed

git commit -m "ADded test folder"


Send your new version to GitHub:


git push origin main




Fourth  we need to creates a tag with a release version of all the files with changes and a message


git tag -a v1.0.11 -m "Added Test Folder and new changes"



Push the tag to GitHub to get older folder zip


git push origin v1.0.0
